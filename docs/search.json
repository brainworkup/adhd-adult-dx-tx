    "text": "The Diagnostic Challenge\nNo “gold standard” exists for adult ADHD diagnosis\n\nAdult ADHD affects 5-7% of adults, yet diagnosis remains complex\nHyperactivity symptoms often diminish with age, making detection harder\nSubstantial symptom overlap with depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder\nMost diagnoses made in primary care, not by specialists\nGrowing concern about stimulant-seeking for cognitive enhancement\n\nClinical Reality: We lack a definitive test and must rely on imperfect tools with widely variable performance characteristics.\n\nThis slide sets the stage by highlighting why adult ADHD diagnosis is so challenging. The absence of a gold standard means we’re working with uncertainty from the start."

They excel at either sensitivity OR specificity, rarely both."
