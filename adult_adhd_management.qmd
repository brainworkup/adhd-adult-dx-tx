## The Diagnostic Challenge {.smaller}

**No "gold standard" exists for adult ADHD diagnosis**

- Adult ADHD affects 5-7% of adults, yet diagnosis remains complex
- Hyperactivity symptoms often diminish with age, making detection harder
- Substantial symptom overlap with depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder
- Most diagnoses made in primary care, not by specialists
- Growing concern about stimulant-seeking for cognitive enhancement

**Clinical Reality:** We lack a definitive test and must rely on imperfect tools with widely variable performance characteristics.

::: notes
This slide sets the stage by highlighting why adult ADHD diagnosis is so challenging. The absence of a gold standard means we're working with uncertainty from the start.

## Self-Report Questionnaires: Variable but Practical {.smaller}

**Performance across 44 studies:**

- **Sensitivity:** 14% to 100% (highly variable)
- **Specificity:** 10% to 99% (highly variable)
- **Administration time:** <30 minutes
- **False negative rates:** 12-90%

**Clinical Takeaway:** Self-report scales (CAARS, ASRS, WURS) are quick screening tools but performance depends heavily on:

- Cutoff thresholds used
- Comparison population (healthy vs. clinical)
- Presence of comorbidities

**Use as initial screening, but never as sole diagnostic tool**

::: notes
Self-reports are the workhorses of ADHD assessment but their extreme variability means we need to understand their limitations. They excel at either sensitivity OR specificity, rarely both.

## Neuropsychological Testing: Not Worth the Investment {.smaller}

**Continuous Performance Tests (CPTs) and cognitive batteries:**

- **Sensitivity:** 17-93% (mostly fair to poor)
- **Specificity:** 40-100%
- **Administration time:** ~20 minutes
- **Cost:** Significantly higher than self-reports

**Critical Finding:** Neuropsychological tests perform **no better** than self-report questionnaires despite being more expensive and time-intensive

**Clinical Recommendation:** Do not routinely use neuropsychological testing for ADHD diagnosis - reserve for specific cognitive profiling needs

::: notes
This is a key finding that challenges common practice. Despite their objectivity and cost, neuropsychological tests don't outperform simple questionnaires.

## Combination Diagnostic Approaches Work Best {.smaller}

**Multi-modal assessment outperforms single tools:**

- **Sensitivity:** 43-94% (mostly good)
- **Specificity:** 82-94% (acceptable)
- **False positive rates:** 16-18% (moderate)

**Effective combinations include:**

- Self-report + informant ratings
- Self-report + clinical interview
- Multiple self-report scales + demographic variables

**Clinical Application:** Always combine multiple information sources - never rely on a single assessment method

::: notes
The evidence strongly supports using multiple assessment methods together rather than any single tool in isolation.

## Medications: Effective but with Trade-offs {.smaller}

**FDA-approved stimulants and non-stimulants (87 studies):**

**Benefits:**

- **ADHD symptoms:** Medium effect (SMD -0.64, High SoE)
- **Functional impairment:** Small benefit (SMD -0.46, Moderate SoE)
- **Cognitive performance:** Small benefit (SMD 0.25, Moderate SoE)

**Risks:**

- **Insomnia:** 2.7Ã— higher risk (Moderate SoE)
- **Any adverse event:** 33% increased risk
- **Blood pressure:** Small increase (SMD 0.16)

**No difference between stimulants and non-stimulants in efficacy**

::: notes
Medications remain the most studied intervention with strongest evidence. The benefits are clear but so are the risks, particularly for sleep.
:::

## Psychosocial Interventions: Surprisingly Effective {.smaller}

**CBT, DBT, and mindfulness-based therapies (39 studies):**

**Strong benefits:**

- **ADHD symptoms:** Large effect (SMD -0.79, Moderate SoE)
- **Functional impairment:** Medium effect (SMD -0.69, Moderate SoE)

**Key components of effective programs:**

- Psychoeducation about ADHD
- Executive function training
- Problem-solving skills
- Mindfulness practices
- Homework and skill practice

**Clinical Insight:** Psychosocial interventions rival medications for symptom reduction without the adverse effects

::: notes
This is perhaps the most surprising finding - psychosocial interventions show large effect sizes comparable to or exceeding medications.
:::

## Combined Treatment: Modest Additional Benefit {.smaller}

**Medication + Psychosocial therapy (14 studies):**

- **ADHD symptoms:** Small additional benefit (SMD -0.38, Moderate SoE)
- **Not clearly superior** to either treatment alone
- Most studies compared combination vs. monotherapy, not placebo

**Clinical Implication:** 

- Start with either medication OR psychosocial intervention based on patient preference
- Add second modality if response insufficient
- Don't assume combination is automatically better

::: notes
Contrary to common assumption, combining treatments doesn't produce dramatic synergy - the additional benefit is modest.

## Emerging Treatments: Limited Evidence {.smaller}

**Insufficient evidence for routine use:**

**Neurostimulation (6 studies):**

- Improves cognitive performance (SMD 0.55) 
- No effect on ADHD symptoms

**Neurofeedback (5 studies):**

- Inconsistent results, evidence insufficient

**Cognitive training (6 studies):**

- Small cognitive benefit (SMD 0.31)
- No effect on ADHD symptoms

**Supplements, exercise, CAM:**

- Very limited studies
- No consistent benefits demonstrated

::: notes
Despite theoretical promise, these newer interventions lack sufficient evidence for clinical recommendation.

## Context Matters: Real-World Performance {.smaller}

**Diagnostic accuracy drops dramatically in clinical populations:**

- Tools distinguish ADHD from **healthy controls** well
- Performance plummets when distinguishing ADHD from **other psychiatric conditions**
- Comorbidity (present in majority) significantly affects specificity

**Treatment response moderators show limited effects:**

- **Age:** Minimal impact on treatment response
- **Sex:** No consistent differences
- **ADHD subtype:** Similar responses across types
- **Comorbidities:** May affect response but findings mixed

**Key Message:** Our patients rarely present as "pure ADHD" - expect diagnostic uncertainty and treatment complexity

::: notes
This reflects the messy reality of clinical practice - our patients have multiple conditions that complicate both diagnosis and treatment.

## Clinical Practice Recommendations {.smaller}

**For Diagnosis:**

1. Start with validated self-report screening (ASRS, CAARS)
2. Always obtain collateral information
3. Conduct thorough clinical interview for childhood onset
4. Screen for common comorbidities (depression, anxiety, SUD)
5. Skip routine neuropsychological testing

**For Treatment:**

1. Discuss medication vs. psychosocial therapy as first-line options
2. Consider patient preference and adverse effect tolerance
3. Monitor sleep carefully with stimulants
4. Don't assume combination therapy is needed initially
5. Address comorbidities concurrently

**Remember:** Most evidence is LOW to MODERATE strength - individualized care remains essential

::: notes
These practical recommendations synthesize the evidence into actionable clinical guidance while acknowledging the limitations of our knowledge base.
